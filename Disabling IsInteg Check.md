# Disabling IsInteg Check

## Problem:

IsInteg is an automatic repair code that was added to fix corruptions in large mailboxes. Auto repair could take a long time. Not sure how long we wait/make it best effort.

Customer migrations were stuck behind IsInteg not completing and times out after 4 hrs. This was added for MidSet Corruptions so can make sure missing items don\'t happen when the migrations run. Without this, the migrations would happen and towards the end it would fail due to missing items during finalization. It is possible that there is no midset corruptions at all, so skipping this at times may help the user make progress with the moves.

The customer can run the repair themselves

`New-MailboxRepairRequest -CorruptionType MessageId`

This would run the repair beforehand and not cause this to be hit during migrations

## Solution:

In the meanwhile, did 2 things to make progress here.

- Added the following workaround to disable this

  `Set-ExchangeSettings MRS -CreateSettingsGroup -GroupName UnblockAlphaVilleUrbanismo -ConfigPairs @(\"DisableAutomaticRepair=true\") -ScopeFilter \"(MailboxGuid -eq \'938ba0f8-9a45-432c-886b-9554bfe232aa\')\" -reason \"CFL 876974 Fatal error JobStuckPermanentException has occurred\" -ExpirationDate 10/01/2018`

  `Set-ExchangeSettings MRS -CreateSettingsGroup -GroupName 1484159UnblockISInteg -ConfigPairs @(\"DisableAutomaticRepair=true\") -ScopeFilter \"(OrganizationName -like \'emiratesfoundationae0.onmicrosoft.com\')\" -reason \"CFL 1484159 Store IsInteg task is pending completion\" -ExpirationDate 06/06/2020`

- Asked the customer to restart the move
